		<h1>Our Tech Stack</h1>
		<h2>Service-oriented Architecture</h2>
		<p>
			We operate using a service-oriented architecture (SOA). This enables us to have
			multiple ways for users to consume data and issue commands without fracturing
			data logic throughout all the apps.
		</p>
		<p>
			We use a <b>presentation layer</b> for shaping data in the form of APIs for mobile applications/partners
			or rendering HTML for a customer's browser. This layer is mostly concerned with display logic.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <b>service layer</b> is responsible for business logic and data persistence.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <b>data layer</b> is the various database technologies we use to store and query information.
			The presentation layer never talks directly to our data layer to prevent all the applications from
			forming their own business rules.
		</p>

		<h2>Development Languages</h2>
		<p>
			We primarily use <b>PHP 8</b> as our main server language and <b>Javascript (Typescript)</b> as our front-end language.
			Our presentation layer makes use of <a href="https://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a>, while our service layer makes use of a custom micro-framework.
		</p>
		<p>
			For our component-driven designed applications, we use <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue 3</a> with scoped css for styling.
		</p>
		<p>
			For non-component-driven applications, we use the css pre-processor <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation">Sass</a> with a <a href="https://en.bem.info/methodology/css/">BEM</a> style approach.
		</p>
		<h2>Deploying Code</h2>
		<p>
			We use Github as our primary code repository storage. Engineers create feature branches and open pull requests to our main branch.
			An Azure Pipeline CI process lints, runs tests, and ensures the build works.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once the pull request is reviewed by another engineer and all the tests pass, the engineer merges the pull request and then tests
			in their changes behind a feature flag in production.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, when the engineer is satisfied, the feature flag is opened to allow customers.
