		<h1>Our Teams</h1>
		<p>
			At Zumba&trade;, our technology department is broken into the following sections:
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><b>UI/UX</b></dt>
			<dd>User interface and experience team, responsible with how our customers interact with the applications.</dd>
			<dt><b>Operations</b></dt>
			<dd>Operations team handles the infrastructure that hosts our applications.</dd>
			<dt><b>QA</b></dt>
			<dd>Quality Assurance team automates synthetic tests to ensure that all critical parts of the application are functioning as expected.</dd>
			<dt><b>BI</b></dt>
			<dd>Business Intelligence team automates capturing key metrics to aid the rest of the business in making decisions.</dd>
			<dt><b>Product Management</b></dt>
			<dd>The PM team are stakeholders of the products we ship and ensure the project requirements match business expectations.</dd>
			<dt><b>Engineering</b></dt>
			<dd>Engineering team develop applications to serve our customers' needs.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
			We further subdivide our engineering section into self-contained teams with 4-5 members each.
			Each engineering team is constructed to take a project or feature
			all the way from design to deploying to customers. With support from
			a lead engineer, a product manager, and our ops teams, teams have autonomy
			to make technical decisions and control the outcome of the project.
		</p>
		<p>
			We're an agile/scrum shop, so work is estimated and put into a two-week sprint.
			Each engineer is assigned features or bug tickets by their lead to be completed in that sprint.
		</p>

		<p>
			Most teams do not specialize in any specific area. We try to maintain cross-functional teams to prevent siloing of information and reduce the bus factor.
			This also empowers engineers to solve problems in any area that they are needed.
